        My name is Milon Lonappan. My birthday is on the 26th of February, and I am 19 years old. I am originally from India and moved to the United States about 3 years ago. Since then, I enrolled myself into junior year of high school and got myself in track to go to a four year university. Through hard work and struggles (I am lying :D), I was able to perform well enough to get accepted into University of California, San Diego among 12 other colleges. After a year of classes at UCSD, I am taking a year off and am enrolled in a local community college.
